In this project you can extract the tar file here and run condor_submit submit.sub.
This will download and filter the necessary data files for Madison for each year.
The files downloaded will be madison2019.csv, madison2020.csv,..., madison2024.csv.
The R scripts will need to be run locally with these files in the same directory.
The Project_main.R performs exploratory analysis, SARIMA modeling, and multiple linear regression.
The Project_compare.R compares the Madison data with that of Los Angeles. Los Angeles data was downloaded seperately and can be downloaded at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-hourly?pageNum=1&stations=72295023174
